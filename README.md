15.What is the purpose of the setState() method?

Answer: The setState() method is used to tell the Flutter framework that the state of the widget has changed, which triggers a rebuild of the widget.

16.What is the difference between hot reload and hot restart in Flutter?

Answer: Hot reload preserves the app's state while injecting updated code into the app, whereas hot restart resets the state and reloads the app from scratch.

17.How does navigation work in Flutter?

Answer: Navigation in Flutter is managed by the Navigator class, which maintains a stack of routes. You can push a route using Navigator.push() and pop a route using Navigator.pop().

18.What is a Route in Flutter?

Answer: A Route is an abstraction for a screen or page in Flutter. It is used to navigate between different screens or pages in an app.

19.What is a FutureBuilder in Flutter?

Answer: A FutureBuilder is a widget that builds itself based on the latest snapshot of interaction with a Future.

What is the difference between Padding and Margin in Flutter?

Answer: Padding is the space inside a widget's border, whereas Margin is the space outside a widget's border.
What is an InheritedWidget in Flutter?

Answer: An InheritedWidget is a widget that allows state to be passed down the widget tree efficiently.
How do you optimize performance in Flutter?

Answer: Performance in Flutter can be optimized by minimizing widget rebuilds, using const constructors, avoiding unnecessary state changes, using efficient data structures, and profiling the app.
What are constraints in Flutter?

Answer: Constraints in Flutter are the rules that determine a widget's size and position within its parent widget.
What is a CustomPainter in Flutter?

Answer: A CustomPainter is a class that enables custom drawing on the canvas. It is used for creating complex and custom shapes.
How do you handle platform-specific functionality in Flutter?

Answer: Platform-specific functionality can be handled using platform channels, which allow communication between Dart code and native code (Java/Kotlin for Android, Swift/Objective-C for iOS).
What is a Theme in Flutter?

Answer: A Theme in Flutter is a collection of design choices, such as colors, fonts, and shapes, which can be applied across the app to maintain a consistent look and feel.
What is the purpose of the main() function in Flutter?

How do you debug a Flutter application?

Answer: Debugging in Flutter can be done using various tools like Dart DevTools, the Flutter Inspector, logging, breakpoints, and the console.
What are Hot Reload and Hot Restart?

Answer: Hot Reload injects updated code into a running Dart Virtual Machine, preserving the state of the app. Hot Restart completely restarts the app and loses the app state.
What is the difference between Navigator.pushNamed and Navigator.push?

Answer: Navigator.pushNamed navigates to a named route defined in the app's route table, while Navigator.push requires a route object.
What is a ModalRoute in Flutter?
